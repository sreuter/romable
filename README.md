# Romable

An electron-based ROM manager for the masses.

## Current state

You can select a folder full of roms and export things to a nice folder structure.

## Todo / Ideas

- Refactor (allthethings)
- Show progress for copy/export operation by changing background color of row green or red (on failure)
- Add system detection for other than Gameboy
- Show tickable filter for codes
- Allow removal of () [] codes from filename for export
- Make it pretty
- Package app for Windows/Linux/OSX
- Covers, somehow?
- Make external (CDN) dependencies local
